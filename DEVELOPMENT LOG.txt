Changes from Lab1
*****************
The rendering for the course is still done using Fixed Function Pipeline; OpenGL 2.3
We added more files to encompass the scope of the Physics Engine, including defining a Rigidbody class
that holds our ball. We also made our tiles and walls inherit a class called Quad; this is for interaction 
with the Engine. We began on more camera options but the Third Person view is incomplete. We also still don't
have a proper GUI so we still use the keyboard for interactivity.

Refactoring Code
****************
As stated, we added more files and made some existing classes inherit another class that helps us
with the movement and interaction in the space.

Additional
****************
The code is still in development. As such, a lot of commented out test statements and improper organization in the code.
